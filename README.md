I only recently began coding, October 2025, I started off mainly only learning to<br>
customise better and to build my own personal site. But as I made my way through the<br>
HTML rabbit hole. I ended up getting into the C programing language, with the hopes<br>
of getting into hardware. As of right now im mainly working with arduinos.<br>

Again, because I am a newbie, I am still getting the hang of github I dont plan<br>
for employment I just like the idea of showcasing my projects. And also because <br>
I love overdecorating so much I doubt I could ever be professional on such open-sourced<br>
sites. (ᵕ- ᴗ -)<br>
